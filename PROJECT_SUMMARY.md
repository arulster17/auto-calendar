**Last Updated:** 2026-02-17
**Status:** ✅ APIs Set Up - Bot Running & In Active Development
**Version:** 1.2.0

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Read This File First

**This file is the primary handoff document for AI assistants working on this project.**

When you start a conversation about this codebase:
1. **Read this file completely** - It contains everything you need to understand the project architecture, design decisions, and current state
2. Use other documentation files (SETUP.md, FEATURES.md, DEPENDENCIES.md) for specific implementation details
3. This file is maintained as the single source of truth for project context

**Why this matters:** This bot uses AI at every layer. Understanding the multi-layer AI architecture, context passing, and unified parsing approach is critical before making changes.

---

## Quick Start for New AI Assistant

**TLDR:** This is Alfred, a fully operational Discord bot that creates calendar events, provides fun facts, and handles basic conversation. APIs are set up, bot works, user is actively developing it.

**Current State:**
- ✅ Bot is running locally and tested
- ✅ Named "Alfred" with defined personality (professional, friendly, task-focused)
- ✅ Three features: Calendar (creates Google Calendar events) + Fun Facts + Conversation (handles greetings/small talk)
- ✅ All APIs configured (Discord, Gemini, Google Calendar)
- 🔄 User is refining natural language understanding and routing

**What to Know:**
- User wants this to be a general-purpose assistant (not just calendar)
- Calendar is the first "task feature" - more will be added
- Bot should be conversational but redirect to tasks (not a chatbot)
- DM-first design (personal assistant, not server bot)
- All free APIs, modular architecture

### The Vision

A general-purpose **personal assistant via Discord DMs** that can:
- Understand what you're asking in natural language
- Route to the appropriate feature automatically (via AI, not keywords)
- Handle any task: calendar, email, reminders, weather, todos, file management, etc.
- Work 24/7 from Discord DMs (even when laptop is closed)
- **DM-first design**: Private, one-on-one interaction with the bot

---

## Current State

### ✅ What's Built

**Core Infrastructure:**
- Discord bot framework with AI-powered intent routing
- Google Gemini integration for natural language understanding (gemini-2.5-flash)
- Modular feature system (easy to add new capabilities)
- Google Calendar integration
- **Conversation context system**: Remembers last 10 messages from last 15 minutes (hybrid approach)
  - Enables follow-up messages like "make it 2 hours" or "change that to 3pm" or "actually rename them to..."
  - Per-user context tracking
  - Automatic cleanup of old messages
  - **All features receive context** - passed to Calendar, Fun Facts, and Conversation features
- **Startup notification**: Bot sends "✅ Ready to go!" DM to owner on startup (optional, via DISCORD_OWNER_ID)

**Features Implemented:**
1. **Calendar Feature** - Create and modify Google Calendar events from natural language
   - Location: `src/features/calendar_feature.py`
   - **Unified AI parsing**: Single Gemini call interprets intent and extracts all data
   - No hardcoded keywords - purely meaning-based understanding
   - Automatically determines create vs modify based on context

   **Event Creation:**
   - Supports: recurring events, location, custom notifications/reminders
   - Creates events via Google Calendar API with popup notifications
   - Smart title generation: Creates brief titles with details in description
   - Example: "meeting about buying phone" → Title: "Phone Purchase Meeting", Description: "Discuss buying a new phone"
   - Reminders: "meeting at 3pm with 1 hour notification" → Creates popup reminder 60 minutes before
   - **Formatted output**: Shows readable times (Mon, Feb 17 at 3:00 PM), location, recurrence status
   - Multiple events: Shows full details for each event with indentation

   **Event Modification:**
   - Search existing events by name/keywords
   - Modify: title, description, location, reminders
   - Supports bulk modifications (e.g., "rename all office hours to tutor hours")
   - Add reminders: "add 1 hour notification to CSE 127 office hours"
   - All parsing done by AI - no keyword matching
   - **Formatted output**: Shows modified event name, recurrence status, and all changed properties

2. **Fun Fact Feature** - Provide interesting random facts
   - Location: `src/features/fun_fact_feature.py`
   - Uses Gemini to generate interesting, accurate fun facts
   - Responds to: "tell me a fun fact", "share something interesting", etc.
   - Brief, engaging responses (2-3 sentences)
   - Context-aware: Can provide related facts based on conversation topic

3. **Conversation Feature** - Handle greetings, small talk, and general questions
   - Location: `src/features/conversation_feature.py`
   - Provides friendly, brief responses to non-task messages
   - Gently redirects to task-oriented help
   - Fallback for messages that don't match other features

**Bot Personality (Alfred):**
- Named "Alfred" - a professional but friendly AI assistant
- Location: `src/config/bot_context.py`
- Defined personality: Professional, concise, helpful, task-oriented

## Architecture Deep Dive

### How It Works

```
User sends Discord message
    ↓
Discord Bot receives message
    ↓
AI Intent Router (Gemini)
    ├─ Analyzes user intent
    ├─ Compares against all feature capabilities
    └─ Selects best matching feature (confidence score)
    ↓
Selected Feature Handler
    ├─ Processes the request
    └─ Returns response
    ↓
Bot replies to user
```

### Key Design Decisions

**1. AI-Powered Intent Detection (Zero Hardcoded Keywords)**
- **Feature-level routing**: Gemini routes messages to correct feature (Calendar, Fun Facts, Conversation)
- **Sub-intent detection**: Calendar feature uses AI to detect create vs modify intent
- No hardcoded keyword matching - fully meaning-based
- Each feature describes its capabilities in natural language
- AI understands intent regardless of phrasing
- Easy to extend: just add new features and describe what they do

**2. Modular Feature System**
- Each feature is independent module in `src/features/`
- Features implement: `get_capabilities()` and `handle()`
- Register feature → AI automatically learns to route to it
- No changes to core bot logic needed

**3. AI-Powered Personality (Alfred)**
- Bot has consistent personality defined in `bot_context.py`
- Named "Alfred" - professional, friendly, task-oriented assistant
- Conversation feature handles small talk while staying focused
- Can engage briefly (1-2 exchanges) before redirecting to tasks
- All features use the same personality context

**4. Streamlined AI Pipeline** (Model: gemini-2.5-flash)
- **Call 1**: Route message to correct feature (Calendar, Fun Facts, Conversation)
- **Call 2** (if calendar): Single unified parse - detects intent (create/modify) AND extracts all structured data in one call
- **Call 2** (if conversation/fun facts): Generate contextual response
- Cost: 2 Gemini API calls per user message (well within free tier)
- All features use gemini-2.5-flash model
- Fully AI-driven - zero hardcoded keyword matching
- Calendar feature uses comprehensive prompt that handles all cases in one request

**5. Discord DMs as Interface**
- Personal assistant via Discord DMs (DM-first design)
- Works on phone, desktop, web
- Can run 24/7 on free cloud hosting
- Bot responds to DMs automatically (no @mention needed)
- Can also respond if @mentioned in servers, but designed for personal DM use
- No need for local Mac/laptop to stay on

## How to Add a New Feature (Quick Reference)

**Pattern used:**
1. Create `src/features/feature_name.py` with class that has:
   - `__init__`: Set `self.name` and `self.description`
   - `get_capabilities()`: Return detailed string describing what it handles
   - `async handle(message, message_text)`: Process request, return string response

2. Register in `src/services/discord_handler.py` in `_load_features()`:
   ```python
   from features.feature_name import FeatureName
   feature = FeatureName()
   self.router.register_feature(feature)
   ```

3. AI automatically learns to route to it based on capabilities description

**Important:** Task features should be registered BEFORE conversation feature (order matters for routing priority)

**See existing features as examples:**
- `calendar_feature.py` - Complex feature with external API
- `conversation_feature.py` - Simple feature with AI response generation

**Full guide:** FEATURES.md

## Environment Variables

Required in `.env`:

```bash
# Discord Bot
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token

# Google Gemini AI (for routing + parsing)
GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key

# Google Calendar
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID=primary  # or specific calendar ID for testing
# For testing, you can use a separate calendar ID like:
# GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID=abc123@group.calendar.google.com
```

**Security:** Never commit `.env`, `credentials/`, or `token.pickle` to git!

**Note on Calendar ID:**
- `primary` = your main Google Calendar (recommended for production)
- Use a specific calendar ID (from Calendar Settings → Integrate calendar) for testing
- Format: `[long-hash]@group.calendar.google.com` for sub-calendars
- Switching between calendars just requires updating `.env` and restarting the bot

| Google Calendar API | FREE | Generous quotas | Event creation |
| Hosting (Render/Railway) | FREE | 750 hours/month | 24/7 bot hosting |

**Total:** $0/month for personal use

---

## Common Issues & Solutions (For Debugging)

**Setup Issues (Already Resolved for This Bot):**
- ✅ "No module named 'services'" → Run from `src/` directory
- ✅ Credentials → Already configured
- ✅ Discord intents → Already enabled
- ✅ Can't DM bot → Already in private server

**Potential Runtime Issues:**

**AI Routing Problems:**
- Wrong feature handling message → Check `intent_router.py` confidence threshold (default: 0.6)
- Improve feature's `get_capabilities()` description with more examples
- Check console logs to see which feature was selected and why

**Calendar Parsing Issues:**
- Events created with wrong time/date → Check `gemini_parser.py` prompt
- No events created → User's message might be too ambiguous, check Gemini response in logs
- Check timezone settings in `calendar_service.py`

**Conversation Issues:**
- Alfred too chatty → Adjust prompt in `conversation_feature.py`
- Alfred too rigid → Adjust personality in `bot_context.py`
- Not redirecting to tasks → Check conversation guidelines in `bot_context.py`

**Debug Approach:**
1. Check console logs (shows which feature was selected)
2. Check Gemini API responses (shows what AI understood)
3. Test with very explicit messages first
4. Gradually test more natural language

---

## Key Commands

### Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run bot locally
cd src && python bot.py

# Authenticate Google Calendar (one-time)
cd src && python -c "from services.calendar_service import get_calendar_service; get_calendar_service()"
```

### Bot Commands (in Discord)
- `!help` - Show help and available features
- `!ping` - Check bot responsiveness
- `!features` - List all registered features

---

## Design Philosophy (Why It's Built This Way)

**AI Routing Instead of Keywords:**
- Uses Gemini to understand "what does user want to do?"
- Features describe their own capabilities
- AI matches user intent → best feature
- Scales infinitely (just add features, AI learns them)
- No brittle keyword matching

**Modular Features:**
- Each feature is independent file
- Drop in new feature → register it → AI routes to it automatically
- Easy to test, disable, or remove features
- Features can be shared across projects

**Conversation as Fallback:**
- Conversation feature registered LAST (lower priority)
- Task features get first chance at routing
- Only non-task messages go to conversation
- Keeps bot task-focused while still being friendly

**Alfred's Personality:**
- Single source of truth in `bot_context.py`
- All features can use same personality context
- Consistent tone across all interactions
- Professional but friendly, concise, helpful

- Debug specific routing or parsing issues

**What NOT to Suggest:**
- Don't suggest redoing API setup (already done)
- Don't make it overly chatty (task-focused, not chatbot)
- Don't suggest server features (this is DM-first personal assistant)
- Don't over-engineer simple requests

---

## Critical Context for AI Assistant (READ THIS)

**User's Priorities:**
1. **Natural language first** - Users should phrase things naturally, not use keywords
2. **Extensible architecture** - Easy to add unlimited features without changing core
3. **Task-focused personality** - Can do small talk but redirects to being helpful
4. **Completely free** - All APIs must be free tier
5. **DM-first design** - Personal assistant via Discord DMs, not server bot
6. **Simple, clean code** - Don't over-engineer

**Architecture Principles:**
- **AI routing** over keyword matching (using Gemini to understand intent)
- **Modular features** - each feature is independent, drop-in module
- **Consistent personality** - Alfred's context defined once, used everywhere
- **Features register themselves** - AI learns capabilities automatically

**User's Development Style:**
- Actively developing with you in iterative sessions
- Wants you to update PROJECT_SUMMARY.md as changes are made
- Values working code over documentation
- Prefers simple solutions over complex ones

**What NOT to Do:**
- ❌ Don't suggest keyword-based routing
- ❌ Don't make Alfred overly chatty (he's task-focused)
- ❌ Don't make calendar-specific suggestions (this is general assistant)
- ❌ Don't suggest paid APIs or services
- ❌ Don't over-engineer simple requests
- ❌ Don't forget to update this file when making significant changes

**When User Says "adjust project summary":**
- They mean this file (PROJECT_SUMMARY.md)
- Update it to reflect current state accurately
- This file is FOR YOU (future Claude sessions) to get up to speed quickly
- Focus on actionable info, not marketing copy

**Development History:**
- **Session 1 (Initial):** Built core architecture, calendar feature, AI routing

  - Bot tested and operational

**Current Session Status (2026-02-17):**
- ✅ Bot running and working
- ✅ Calendar creating/modifying events with proper titles, descriptions, recurrence, location, reminders
- ✅ Conversation context system implemented (hybrid: last 10 messages from last 15 minutes)
- ✅ Console logging shows user messages, Alfred's responses, and context info
- ✅ **FIXED:** Switched to gemini-flash-latest (working free tier model)
- ✅ Better error handling for rate limits (user-friendly messages)
- 🔄 In active development - iterating on features

## 🚨 Current Issues & Solutions

### **Issue #1: Gemini API Free Tier Quota Exhausted**

**Problem:**
- gemini-2.5-flash: 20 requests/day limit (too low)
- gemini-2.0-flash: 0 requests/day limit on free tier (not available for free!)
- Both models hit quota limits quickly during testing

**Error Message:**
```
429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED
Quota exceeded for metric: generativelanguage.googleapis.com/generate_content_free_tier_requests
limit: 0, model: gemini-2.0-flash
```

**Current Workaround:**
- Bot now displays user-friendly error message when rate limits hit
- Error handling added to discord_handler and intent_router
- Users see: "⚠️ I'm currently experiencing API rate limit issues..."

**Permanent Solutions (Pick One):**

1. **Switch to gemini-1.5-pro (if available on free tier)**
   - Check if this model has better free tier quotas
   - May be available with different limits

2. **Use paid Gemini API tier**
   - Pay-as-you-go pricing
   - Much higher rate limits
   - Cost: ~$0.50-$1.00 per 1 million tokens

3. **Switch to different AI provider**
   - OpenAI GPT-3.5/GPT-4
   - Anthropic Claude (ha!)
   - Local models (Ollama)

4. **Implement request batching/caching**
   - Cache routing decisions for similar messages
   - Reduce redundant API calls
   - More complex implementation

**Status:** ⚠️ KNOWN ISSUE - Free tier quotas vary by Gemini model

**Details:**
- Different Gemini models have different free tier limits
- Some models (like gemini-2.0-flash) may have limited free tier availability
- Current workaround: Monitor usage and adjust model choice as needed
- Alternative: Consider upgrading to paid tier if quotas are exceeded
- Check current quotas: https://ai.google.dev/pricing

**Conversation Context Features:**
- Remembers last 10 messages per user
- Only keeps messages from last 15 minutes
- Enables follow-up requests:
  - "Make it 2 hours instead"
  - "Change that to 3pm"
  - "Actually, move it to Friday"
- Context passed to AI router and all features
- Per-user tracking (different users have separate contexts)
- Automatic cleanup of old messages

**Logging Features:**
- Console logs now show conversation flow:
  - 👤 USER messages
  - 📚 Context indicator (shows how many messages in memory)
  - 🤖 AI routing decisions
  - 🤵 ALFRED responses
- Helps with debugging and understanding bot behavior during local development

**Known Technical Details:**
- Bot must be in a Discord server to enable DMs (Discord limitation)
- User created private server for the bot
- Actual usage is via DMs (server is just for Discord's technical requirement)
- Testing with separate calendar ID before using primary calendar
- Discord "user installation" doesn't work for bots - must use server installation

**Deployment Plan:**
- **Platform**: Fly.io (recommended)
  - Free tier: 3 small VMs (256MB RAM each) forever
  - Always-on, no spin-down (critical for reminders feature)
  - Persistent storage included
  - No credit card required for free tier
- **Why not Railway**: Removed free tier, now $5/month minimum
- **Why not Render**: Free tier spins down after 15min inactivity (bad for reminders)

**If User Reports Issues:**
- Likely related to routing (messages going to wrong feature)
- Or parsing (calendar events extracted incorrectly)
- Or conversation boundaries (Alfred too chatty or too rigid)
- Or context not working (follow-ups not understood)
- Ask for specific examples to debug

**Context System Notes:**
- Context is in-memory only (resets on bot restart)
- 15-minute window means conversations "expire" after inactivity
- 10-message limit prevents infinite memory growth
- Each user has separate context (no cross-user contamination)
- Context cleanup happens automatically on each message

---

## Testing Status

- ✅ **Local testing:** Complete - bot running and responding
- ✅ **Calendar feature:** Tested - creating events successfully
- ✅ **AI routing:** Tested - routing between calendar and conversation features
- ✅ **Conversation feature:** Tested - Alfred responding with personality
- ⏳ **Deployment:** Not yet deployed to cloud hosting
- ⏳ **Edge cases:** Ongoing testing and refinement

**Next Testing Goals:**
- Test more complex calendar scenarios (multiple events, various time formats)
- Test conversation boundaries (when to chat vs redirect to tasks)
- Test routing edge cases (ambiguous messages)
